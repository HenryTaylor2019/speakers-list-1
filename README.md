# SpeakersList

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Walkthrough

Basic Landing page with link through to Speakers page. 
Speakers page initally displays all speakers and offers the option to filter by search, country or select all speakers. 
User can add speakers to their program list.

## Stretch Goals

Things I would like to do/add:
1. Lift out the speaker cards and the program list from the speaker-display and create their own components for them
2. Add a modal popup with information for each speaker
3. Implement NgRx 
4. Take some time to understand unit testing
5. Started the task in Angular 12 as the brief suggested and not 10..
